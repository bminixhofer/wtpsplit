# Question answering with Adapters

> **Note:** We have not adapted the following scripts of Hugging Face Transformers:
> - `run_qa_beam_search_no_trainer.py`
> - `run_qa_no_trainer.py`
> - `run_qa_beam_search.py`
> 
> To avoid confusion we have not included these non-adapted versions in the examples of Adapters.

This folder contains several scripts that showcase how to fine-tune a ðŸ¤— Transformers model on a question answering dataset,
like SQuAD. 

## Trainer-based scripts

The [`run_qa.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/question-answering/run_qa.py),
[`run_qa_beam_search.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/question-answering/run_qa_beam_search.py) and [`run_seq2seq_qa.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/question-answering/run_seq2seq_qa.py) leverage the ðŸ¤— [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html) for fine-tuning.

### Fine-tuning BERT on SQuAD1.0

The [`run_qa.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/question-answering/run_qa.py) script
allows to fine-tune any model from our [hub](https://huggingface.co/models) (as long as its architecture has a `ForQuestionAnswering` version in the library) on a question-answering dataset (such as SQuAD, or any other QA dataset available in the `datasets` library, or your own csv/jsonlines files) as long as they are structured the same way as SQuAD. You might need to tweak the data processing inside the script if your data is structured differently.

**Note:** This script only works with models that have a fast tokenizer (backed by the ðŸ¤— Tokenizers library) as it
uses special features of those tokenizers. You can check if your favorite model has a fast tokenizer in
[this table](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index.html#supported-frameworks), if it doesn't you can still use the old version of the script which can be found [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/legacy/question-answering).

Note that if your dataset contains samples with no possible answers (like SQuAD version 2), you need to pass along the flag `--version_2_with_negative`.

This example code fine-tunes BERT on the SQuAD1.0 dataset. It runs in 24 min (with BERT-base) or 68 min (with BERT-large)
on a single tesla V100 16GB.

```bash
python run_qa.py \
  --model_name_or_path bert-base-uncased \
  --dataset_name squad \
  --do_train \
  --do_eval \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 12 \
  --learning_rate 3e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 2 \
  --max_seq_length 384 \
  --doc_stride 128 \
  --output_dir /tmp/debug_squad/ \
  --train_adapter \
  --adapter_config seq_bn \
  --overwrite_output_dir
```

Training with the previously defined hyper-parameters yields the following results:

```bash
f1 = 88.52
exact_match = 81.22
```


### Fine-tuning T5 on SQuAD2.0

The [`run_seq2seq_qa.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/question-answering/run_seq2seq_qa.py) script is meant for encoder-decoder (also called seq2seq) Transformer models, such as T5 or BART. These
models are generative, rather than discriminative. This means that they learn to generate the correct answer, rather than predicting the start and end position of the tokens of the answer.

This example code fine-tunes T5 on the SQuAD2.0 dataset.

```bash
python run_seq2seq_qa.py \
  --model_name_or_path t5-small \
  --dataset_name squad_v2 \
  --context_column context \
  --question_column question \
  --answer_column answers \
  --do_train \
  --do_eval \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 12 \
  --learning_rate 3e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 2 \
  --max_seq_length 384 \
  --doc_stride 128 \
  --output_dir /tmp/debug_seq2seq_squad/ \
  --train_adapter \
  --adapter_config seq_bn \
  --overwrite_output_dir
```
